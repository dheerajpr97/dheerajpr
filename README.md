Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Engineer with a strong evolving interest in Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## About Me 🧑‍💻

M.Sc. graduate in Electrical Systems Engineering, with specialization in Signals & Information Processing. Over three years of academic and practical experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Recently worked on developing solutions to analyze CNN predictions on multimodal sensor data, using Grad-CAM and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques during my time as a student research assistant. Skilled in applying critical thinking to real-world challenges. Eager to develop and deploy AI-based solutions in the automotive or medical industry.

## Projects 🚀

Here are a few projects (and competitions) I've been involved in:

- **[Billiards Motion Prediction](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/fapra_ai_public):** Predicting motion of billiard balls using neural network models (Universität Stuttgart).
- **[AI or Not](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_aiornot):** In this competition, my task was to build a neural network model that can identify AI-generated images.
- **[Ship-Detection](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_shipdetection):** In this competition, my goal was to use satellite imagery to detect ships in ports.
