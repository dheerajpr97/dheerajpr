Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Researcher and Engineer with a strong evolving interest in Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

As a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in Electrical Systems Engineering, I specialize in Computer Vision, Speech Processing, and Signal Processing. With over three years of hands-on experience, I've developed solutions using advanced techniques like Grad-CAM and SHAP for Explainable AI. My work has focused on applying AI to solve real-world problems, particularly in the automotive and medical industries. I'm eager to continue leveraging AI to create impactful solutions and explore new frontiers in these fields.

## Projects üöÄ

Here are a few projects I've been involved with:

- **[Conversational-RAG-DocSearch](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/Conversational-RAG-DocSearch):** Conversational-RAG-DocSearch is an advanced multi-lingual document search and Q&A system that supports conversational queries, PDF uploads, and offers flexible model and embedding options with an interactive UI.
- **[LangChain-SQL-Chat](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/LangChain-SQL-chat):** Building an interactive SQL database interface incorporating LLMs to simplify data querying and exploration.
- **[MRI Segmentation using MedViT](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/MRI-Seg-MedViT):** Fine-tune the MedViT model for precise MRI segmentation and evaluate performance using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics.
- **[Explainable-AI-Non-EEG](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/Explainable-AI-Non-EEG):** Analysis and visualization of Non-EEG biomedical data through Explainable AI techniques.
- **[KITTI-PointNet](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_shipdetection):** Implementation and tools necessary for training and evaluating PointNet models on the KITTI dataset for tasks such as point cloud classification and segmentation.
