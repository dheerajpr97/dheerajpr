Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Researcher and Engineer with a strong evolving interest in Computer-Vision and Deep-Learning. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

M.Sc. graduate in Electrical Systems Engineering, with specialization in Signals & Information Processing. Over three years of academic and practical experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Recently worked on developing solutions to analyze CNN predictions on multimodal sensor data, using Grad-CAM and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques during my time as a student research assistant. Skilled in applying critical thinking to real-world challenges. Eager to develop and deploy AI-based solutions in the automotive or medical industry.

## Projects üöÄ

Here are a few projects I've been involved with:

- **[RAG-LangChain-DocSearch](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/RAG-LangChain-DocSearch):** Implementation of a multi-lingual document search and question-answering system leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain, integrating advanced machine learning models for interactive querying and visualization in probability and random processes.
- **[MRI Segmentation using MedViT](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/MRI-Seg-MedViT):** Fine-tune the MedViT model for precise MRI segmentation and evaluate performance using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics.
- **[Explainable-AI-Non-EEG](https://github.com/dheerajpr97/Explainable-AI-Non-EEG):** Analysis and visualization of Non-EEG biomedical data through Explainable AI techniques.
- **[KITTI-PointNet](https://github.com/asnecemnnit/huggingface_competitions_shipdetection):** Implementation and tools necessary for training and evaluating PointNet models on the KITTI dataset for tasks such as point cloud classification and segmentation.
